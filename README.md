# Aloe - Flashcard Learning App

**Aloe** is a powerful and easy-to-use flashcard learning app for iPad and macOS. It allows users to create flashcard sets, import data, and use an advanced algorithmic learning mode to master their knowledge. Inspired by Quizlet’s Learn Mode, Aloe helps users learn efficiently and track their progress.

## Features

- **Create Flashcard Sets**: Create and manage your own sets of flashcards for any subject.
- **Import Flashcards**: Import flashcards from text using custom delimiters for separating terms and definitions, with options to create or import into existing sets.
- **Algorithmic Learn Mode**: Aloe provides an advanced Learn Mode similar to Quizlet, allowing users to practice with multiple choice, true/false, and written answer modes.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track how many cards you’ve mastered, know, or have missed, and reset progress when needed.
- **Customization Options**: Shuffle cards, and use different learning modes to fit your style.
